"""

Print GFG n times without the loop.

Example:

Input:
5
Output:
GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printGfg() that takes N as parameter and prints N times GFG recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).

Constraint:
1<=N<=1000

            self.printGfg(n - 1)
            print("GFG", end=" ")
